        ),
        body: // your content
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### 2. Queue Offline Action
```dart
// In your BLoC or service
final pendingActions = getIt<PendingActionsService>();

await pendingActions.queueAddToCart(
  productId: '123',
  quantity: 2,
);
```

### 3. Check Online Before Action
```dart
final canProceed = await OfflineModeHelper.checkOnlineOrWarn(
  context,

  allowOffline: false,
);

if (canProceed) {
  // proceed with action
}
```

### 4. Use Offline Mixin
```dart
class ProductPage extends StatefulWidget {
  // ...
}

class _ProductPageState extends State<ProductPage> 
    with OfflineModeMixin {
  
  @override
  void onOffline() {
    // Handle offline event
    showSnackBar('You are offline');
  }

  @override
  void onOnline() {
    // Handle online event
    refreshData();
  }
}
```
